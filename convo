Hi Team , 

I am working on an ftp credentials extractor automation script for which I have made local portal in which if you type your email id , password , select your protocol , then server name and port number it will give all the credential details , senders email id and date received about the ftp I tried it on normal outlook account and it working perfectly there but I think maybe due to issues with authentication and companies security protocols its not working with my organization email id i.e. the guycarp one so I need assistance regarding solving this issues I have also attached the screenshots of details and problem I am encountering with this mail.

Regards
